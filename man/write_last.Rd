\details{
Three types of files are written, based on object class:
\enumerate{
\item For data frames, a tab-separated file via \code{\link[readr:write_delim]{readr::write_tsv()}}.
\item For vectors, a new-line separated file via \code{\link[readr:read_lines]{readr::write_lines()}}.
\item For ggplots, a raster image (by default) via \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave()}}.
\item For other lists, an uncompressed RDS file via \code{\link[readr:read_rds]{readr::write_rds()}}.
}
